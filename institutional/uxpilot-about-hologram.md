# About

**Hologram Messaging** is built by **2060 OÜ**, the innovation lab behind **Verana**, with a mission to rebuild the foundations of the Internet around **trust, ownership, and discovery**.  
We’re creating the first **verifiable messaging layer**—a communication protocol where users own their identities, data, and digital services.

## Chronology

**Inspired by 2060 OÜ’s mission to rebuild the Internet’s foundations**, Hologram reimagines private messaging by addressing its deepest flaws: **trust, ownership, and discovery**.

### Genesis — 2020  
After many sessions at the **Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)**, Fabrice Rochette and Ariel Gentile invent the concept of **Verifiable Trust**.  

**Publication of two foundational specifications:**  
- [Verifiable Trust Specification](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/)  
- [Verifiable Public Registry Specification](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec/)

### First Proofs of Concept — 2021–2022  
Development of the first **Verifiable User Agent**, the [Hologram Messaging App](https://hologram.zone), demonstrates the model’s real-world potential.  
Creation of Verifiable Service chatbots proves that verifiable trust works in practice.  

✅ **Hologram.zone launched**

### Network Development — 2023  
The Internet needs a **public infrastructure for Trust Registries**.  
We began prototyping a decentralized, blockchain-based **Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)** implementation.  

👥 **Team expansion begins**

### Verana Emerges — 2024  
Launch of the **Verana Foundation**, expanding the ecosystem vision around Verifiable Services and Trust Registries.  

✅ **Brand identity established**  
✅ **Ecosystem vision expanded**

### Testnet & Strategic Growth — 2025  
Launch of the **Verana Testnet** and its integration with **Hologram Messaging**, introducing the first **verifiable messaging app** that lets users discover and trust decentralized services.  

🚀 **Testnet launched**
