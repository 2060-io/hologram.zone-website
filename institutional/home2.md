**Visual Concept:**  
- Animated flow: *AI Agent → issues Verifiable Credential → indexed by Verana → searchable via Hologram*.  
- Alternate: Split-screen “Before Hologram” (centralized, unverified) vs “After Hologram” (verifiable, decentralized).

| Centralized apps track user data | DIDComm ensures **end-to-end encryption & local consent** |
| Developers need platforms’ permission | Hologram lets anyone deploy & publish Verifiable Services freely |
| No discoverability for decentralized apps | Verana indexes all Hologram Services for global search |

> **In short:** Hologram gives every AI and service a verifiable digital identity, discoverable across the web.
